"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on premise servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

# Projects

The **[codemelted.rs](https://github.com/codemelted/codemelted.rs)** project aims to deliver a full stack Swiss Army Knife module for software engineers to facilitate easily building solutions. Utilizing the Rust programming language, the module serves as a backbone to engineer solutions for multiple build targets. This is accomplished by implementing 14 domain specific use cases for the most common problems software engineers face.

The full stack Swiss Army Knife approach will support building solutions within the following areas further discussed below.

## Consumable Crate

The [codemelted Crate](https://crates.io/crates/codemelted) provides the ability to write native applications utilizing the 14 domain use cases. This can be from as low-level as a Raspberry Pi to dedicated server services. With the code written in Rust, you gets the speed of C but without the memory safety headaches.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The [codemelted Crate](https://crates.io/crates/codemelted) will also provide an installable `codemelted` CLI command (<mark>NOTE: TO BE DEVELOPED</mark>). This command will help in building terminal scripted solutions within a given terminal environment. This can aid in building DevOps / cloud solutions It will also support general **codemelted.rs** project needs.

## Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

The last item the **[codemelted.rs](https://github.com/codemelted/codemelted.rs)** project will help facilitate is the building of PWAs. One of the final build targets of the [codemelted Crate](https://crates.io/crates/codemelted) will be the `codemelted.js` / `codemelted.wasm` modules. These modules will allow software engineers to build frontend / backend PWA solutions for the browser and JS V8 runtime of choice (i.e Deno or NodeJS) using JS / WASM or
build a fullstack solution in Rust targeting those same runtimes (<mark>NOTE: TO BE DEVELOPED</mark>).

# Support

This project does not want to utilize ads on the different websites. To that end, any support for the two hosted projects and the delivery of content is greatly appreciated.

- <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/codemelted"><img src="https://codemelted.com/assets/images/icon-buy-me-a-coffee.png" height="35px" /> Buy Me A Coffee</a>: Direct support for the CodeMelted content and other services not directly related to the **codemelted.rs** project.
- <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/CodeMelted"><img src="https://codemelted.com/assets/images/icon-github.png" height="35px" /> GitHub Sponsorship</a>: Direct support for the **codemelted.rs** project either through a one time donation or a monthly subscription.
- <a href="https://codemelted.com"><img src="https://codemelted.com/assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png" height="35px" /> Website</a>: My main website where I will blog about this project along with other interest and utilize this crate to build out the main website design goals. Sub-domains specialize the content from the main site and serve as support. Also this website is an installable PWA.
