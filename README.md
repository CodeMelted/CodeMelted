"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on premise servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

# Projects

The **[codemelted.rs](https://github.com/codemelted/codemelted.rs)** project aims to deliver a full stack Swiss Army Knife module for software engineers to facilitate easily building solutions. Utilizing the Rust programming language, the module serves as a backbone to engineer solutions for multiple build targets. This is accomplished by implementing 14 domain specific use cases for the most common problems software engineers face.

The full stack Swiss Army Knife approach will support building solutions within the following areas further discussed below.

## Consumable Crate

The [codemelted Crate](https://crates.io/crates/codemelted) provides the ability to write native applications utilizing the 14 domain use cases. This can be from as low-level as a Raspberry Pi to dedicated server services. With the code written in Rust, you gets the speed of C but without the memory safety headaches.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The [codemelted Crate](https://crates.io/crates/codemelted) will also provide an installable native `codemelted` CLI command. This command will help in building terminal scripted solutions within a given terminal scripting environment. In addition, a wrapper for the `codemelted` native command will come in the form of the `codemelted-cli` command. This will be a PowerShell Core module that wraps the `codemelted` native command but builds upon it utilizing the .NET core environment. This aids in building DevOps / cloud solutions regardless of the scripting terminal environment.

## Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

The last item the **[codemelted.rs](https://github.com/codemelted/codemelted.rs)** project will help facilitate in the building of PWAs. One of the final build targets of the [codemelted Crate](https://crates.io/crates/codemelted) will be the ability to compile as WASM with support of running in the Browser / Deno / NodeJS runtimes. This is accomplished via the `codemelted.js` ES6 module. A carefully constructed module that targets these different runtimes supporting JavaScript or TypeScript development but also serves to provide a bridge to the Rust WASM builds.
