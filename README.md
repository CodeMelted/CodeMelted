"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995.  At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on premise servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

My projects focus on Progress Web Application (PWA) technology exploration. The goal besides learning and having fun is hopefully to deliver something useful to the greater software engineering community.

# Projects

## CodeMelted DEV

Software Engineers are now required to learn multiple languages, technologies, and frameworks in order to fully support full stack engineering. The CodeMelted DEV project aims to simplify this by developing a set of cross platform modules implementing a similar / identical Application Program Interface (API) regardless of the chosen technology covered by this project. It gives the ability to achieve maximum application reach by supporting the development of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). The modules are specifically designed to target each area of the technology stack to deliver PWAs.

**Sites:**

- <a href="https://github.com/CodeMelted/codemelted_developer"><img src="https://codemelted.com/assets/images/icon-github.png" height="35px" /> GitHub Page</a>: Hosts the CodeMelted DEV | Modules project. This is actively developed to provide software engineers the ability to deploy PWAs.

## CodeMelted PWA

<a href="https://codemelted.com"><img src="https://codemelted.com/favicon.png" height="35px" /> CodeMelted PWA</a>: A Progressive Web App serving as a developer resource portal of articles, the CodeMelted DEV project, and photography as every software engineer needs a hobby.

### Desktop

When the PWA is installed, the user will have a Single Page Application (SPA) with a end drawer with other accessible tools. Upon opening it, the user can either open the app within the current SPA window, or select to open the external site as its own app window.

### Mobile

When the PWA is installed on mobile, it will provide a fully integrated app experience. If called from another app, it will be opened as such. If opening one of the linked apps, if installed, that native app will open. If not, then a SPA window will open the external app website.
